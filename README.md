# PROJECT: URBAN SUN (aka Tilt)

Tilt provides 911 operators with extra information from calls to determine whether the caller has made an accidental call or is in a dangerous situation in which they cannot conventionally respond. Tilt provides a directory of recent calls to 911 and morse/binary code that 911 operators can use to better assess the nature of certain calls.
