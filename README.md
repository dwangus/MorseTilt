## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Prerequisite Note -- first requires installation of the "AutomateIt" application!!!

After installing "AutomateIt" and our "MorseTilt", you have to (unfortunately) manually change certain settings in the "AutomateIt" app. **Don't worry, this is a one-time setup!**

- Go into the "AutomateIt" app
- Go to "Restore Rules"
- Choose "External storage"
- Choose "sharedRules____.AiR"
- Choose "Replace Existing Rules" (click 'Yes' at the following prompt)

*Furthermore, if you want to minimize the obtrusiveness of the extra installed "AutomateIt" application, do the following:*

1. *Go to Settings*

	- 'Show Service Notification' under 'Service Settings',
